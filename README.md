_**Arduino based brainfuck interpreter with Adafruit LCD**_

This repo will include various separate .ino files (hot off the Arduino IDE press) until out of pre-alpha (current state) at which point it will be concatenated into a fully fledged Arduino-based brainfuck interpreter with fancy [RGB LCD display](https://www.adafruit.com/products/716) (courtesy Adafruit)

### So far, this will consist of:
* **Editor** - brainfuck editor using buttons on display which will create brainfuck code
* **Interpreter** - to run the aforesaid brainfuck code
* **Load** - Load from EEPROM
* **Save** - Save to EEPROM
* **Debug** - interpret one button press at a time
